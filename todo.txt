**IMPORTANT**
- Hide dev tools via cheat codes/hidden buttons

**BUGS**:

**FEATURES**:
- Overlay resources numbers on top right of image and then have multiple columns, as there will be many items; divide into ores, ingots, products (similarly to "Tools")?
- Selected resource should be highlighted
- Re-arrange columns into tabs in mobile
- Refactor miners and furnaces as arrays that can be added to indefinitely instead of limited number
- Add minimise and maximise buttons to objectives message
- Put flame icon next to product in Resources that is being smelted/anviled
- Miners need pickaxes
    - Creates need to buy more pickaxes and possibly buy auto-buyers
- Mages as better form of furnaces -- runecrafting?
- Display number next to resource count temporarily when it increases (e.g. "+5"), disappears with upward movement and fade
- Hover over resource items to see sell price
- Power-up to greatly increase mining speed temporarily - smashing!
- Light up corresponding resource text when something mined
- Add animations via jQuery + Animate.css library
- Materials required in addition to money to build furnaces etc.
- Make shop sections draggable and re-arrangable
- Allow user to right-click items to 'Sell', 'Sell X' and 'Sell all'

**RANDOM IDEAS**:
- Office assistant 'Picky'/'Axy' to give objectives
- Achievements expandable sidebar
- Miners work faster when you buy kitchen for food
- Progress bar for smelting and smithing (probably redundant after a few purchases)
