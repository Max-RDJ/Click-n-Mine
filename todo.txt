**IMPORTANT**
- Hide dev tools via cheat codes/hidden buttons

**BUGS**:
- Bronze bar should be display flex; appears as block

**FEATURES**:
- Overlay resources numbers on top right of image and then have multiple columns, as there will be many items; divide into ores, ingots, products (similarly to "Tools")?
- Another idea: could make whole game into half an idle/grinding game, half a rogue-like (card-based?) where you use the resources gained during the grind portion of the game. Time limit on grind portions? One grind over 24 hours then next rogue-like level becomes available? Buy equipment for when you go into battle or smith your own. Find loot to be used in idle portion of game
- Selected resource should be highlighted
- Re-arrange columns into tabs in mobile
- Refactor miners and furnaces as arrays that can be added to indefinitely instead of limited number
- Add minimise and maximise buttons to objectives message
- Put flame icon next to product in Resources that is being smelted/anviled
- Add auto-sellers (may not be needed actually)
- Miners need pickaxes
    - Creates need to buy more pickaxes and possibly buy auto-buyers
- Furnaces and other 'machinery' can be individually set to process specific raw material, e.g. one auto-miner on stone, another one copper
- Mages as better form of furnaces -- runecrafting?
- Display number next to resource count temporarily when it increases (e.g. "+5"), disappears with upward movement and fade
- Hover over resource items to see sell price
- Power-up to greatly increase mining speed temporarily - smashing!
- Light up corresponding resource text when something mined
- Add animations via jQuery + Animate.css library
- Add an achievements list, e.g. reach 10K coins
- Make purchasable goodie bag containing random ores
- Have select dropdown for each furnace and blackanvil. Use icons and clicking icon opens up menu of icons of products to select from.
- Materials required in addition to money to build furnaces etc.

**RANDOM IDEAS**:
- Make shop sections draggable and re-arrangable
- Office assistant 'Picky'/'Axy' to give objectives
- Achievements expandable sidebar
- Miners work faster when you buy kitchen for food
- Progress bar for smelting and smithing (probably redundant after a few purchases)
- Add fluctuations in sell prices
