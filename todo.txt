**IMPORTANT**
- Hide dev tools via cheat codes/hidden buttons

**BUGS**:

**FEATURES**:
- Overlay resources numbers on top right of image and then have multiple columns, as there will be many items; divide into ores, ingots, products (similarly to "Tools")?
- Re-arrange columns into tabs in mobile
- Put flame icon next to product in Resources that is being smelted/anviled
- Miners need pickaxes
    - Creates need to buy more pickaxes and possibly buy auto-buyers
- Mages as better form of furnaces -- runecrafting?
- Display number next to resource count temporarily when it increases (e.g. "+5"), disappears with upward movement and fade
- Hover over resource items to see sell price and/or stats
- Power-up to greatly increase mining speed temporarily - smashing!
- Light up corresponding resource text when something mined
- Materials required in addition to money to build furnaces etc.
- Make shop sections draggable and re-arrangable
- Get rid of objectives drawer? Just click objectives tab to show game message again

**RANDOM IDEAS**:
- Office assistant 'Picky'/'Axy' to give objectives
- Achievements (not objectives) expandable sidebar
- Miners work faster when you buy kitchen for food
- Progress bar for smelting and smithing (probably redundant after a few purchases)
